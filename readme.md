# 00_web_task_automator.py

# Programming Language:

  - Python 3.9.7
  - Runs on your Python interpreter.
  
# About the program:

  This is just a basic program to assist me in my daily tasks. The website in question is an English learning platform, and the path it follows is to check for teacher availability. The task of navigating through this path is now automated :D, making it easier to secure better study time slots. It utilizes webbrowser, pyautogui, and time modules for automation control.

# Important considerations:

  The coordinates used in the Cartesian plane consider the dimensions of my monitor and the website buttons. I suggest adapting them to your program by initially discovering the points with the following code block:

          '''
          Mostra a posição atual do cursos do mouse.
          '''
          while True:
            time.sleep(5)
            print(pyautogui.position())


# Covered concepts:

    - Módulos: webbrowser, pyautogui and time
    
# Remarks:

  I consider this an interesting project to reinforce the idea that everything can be automated. It touches on different aspects of each module and can be adapted for other tasks. There will definitely be logic errors and room for better algorithms, but I hope it helps you in some way. I appreciate any suggestions for improvement. Best regards.
